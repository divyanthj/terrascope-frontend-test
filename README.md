# Frontend take-home assignment for Terrascope

This is a frontend take-home assignment for Terrascope. The app basically shows a list of cards or "ideas" and lets the user add, delete or update them.
For convenience, we have both client and server on the same host.

## Installation

In the root folder, install frontend (client) dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Then navigate to server folder using `cd server` to install backend (server) dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Running

Go back to root folder and run

```
npm run dev
```

This will automatically start both client and server
